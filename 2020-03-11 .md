## My day today was
It was a very productive day for, I struggled a lot with building the  Product Landing Project especially with adding input fields inside the form, corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field and I also struggled with creating nav-links but I made sure I work hard on my own until I was able to resolve everything myself. I honestly learned a lot today and I am looking forward to applying nav-links and adding input fields on my website. I enjoyed my day today, every moment here is just the best, learning new things is what I look forward to every morning when I wake up.
