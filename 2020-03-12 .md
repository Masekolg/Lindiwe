## How my day unfolded
Hi,today was another good day with its own challenges.I was building a *Technical Documentation Page* I struggled and still struggling with putting text under my link lists for when I click on it can show my text,so I failed finishing it today. I added some link list on my website as I learned doing that yesterday so I decided to apply it today on my website which was very successful.I also did typing practise on **TypingClub**.
