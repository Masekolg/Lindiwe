# What I was up to today
Today has been a good day.
I was doing my third project on freecodecamp which is to **Build a Product Landing Page**,I met some challenges while doing it  especially with User Story #6 where the guideline was saying, **I can watch an embedded product video with id="video"** but I'm looking forward to finishing it tomorrow.
I also got to do a lot of typing today,I Mean I can't be a coder that can't type without looking on the keyboard.
