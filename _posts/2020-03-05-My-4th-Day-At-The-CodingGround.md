# How my day was
Today was a very successful day,first thing I got up to early in the morning was to do freecodecamp, where I was introduced into **Introduction to the CSS Grid Challenges** where I did things like adding columns with grid-template-column,adding rows with grid-template-rows.
I also started with creating my website and I also did typing on  typing club.
All in all today was a day full of its own challenges yet very interesting and nice to learn new things.
