## Its a friday

Wow-what a day that ended so great, my morning coming here wasn't so good, I got stuck in Traffic for about 20minutes which led me to be 15minutes late for school. When I got here we met Theo who addressed us and I got to also ask some questions which were answered for me like how to prioritize my duties at the Coding Ground as everything is important for us to attend to. Well, what made my day so bright and very exciting today is the fact that I did my first project on freecodecamp, which was to build a tribute page on which I spoke about the Mother of the Nation, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The feeling I got when I tested the project and it passed was priceless, now right there I felt like a champ, just to see how I was able to use HTML and CSS on my project.I feel today was very fruitful than most of the days this week.
